This is an android project where I want to implement a simple music player which when loaded looks for 
all the mp3 files on the phone and puts them into a playlist. The user will be able to look at the lyrics 
of the music which is rendered by the program itself based on the title and author of the song. Future 
improvements target a last.fm support and the ability to create custom playlists and using SQLite the
program will monitor the changes and updates of music files on the phone.
